## 📞 Questions to Expect

**Q: Why Next.js over Create React App?**  
A: Next.js provides server-side rendering, better SEO, built-in routing, and automatic code splitting. It's the industry standard for production React apps.

**Q: How would you scale this?**  
A: Phase 2 adds PostgreSQL, authentication, and API routes. I'd implement caching, optimize images, add CDN, and consider GraphQL for complex data fetching.

**Q: What about testing?**  
A: Next step would be Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, and Playwright for E2E tests. I'd aim for 80%+ coverage on critical paths.

**Q: How do you handle state management?**  
A: Currently using custom hooks with localStorage. For Phase 2, I'd consider Zustand or React Query for server state management.

**Q: What about security?**  
A: Phase 2 adds authentication, input sanitization, CSRF protection, and rate limiting. I'd follow OWASP guidelines.
